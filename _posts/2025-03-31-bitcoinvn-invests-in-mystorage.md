While we have been slow to disclose, we plan to follow up in the coming weeks with additional official announcements on investments our team has made in recent months.

If you’re interested in what has caught our attention and where we’ve allocated capital, stay tuned - more updates will be published on BitcoinVN News in the weeks ahead.

The team of BitcoinVN is happy to disclose a further investment made into a locally grown - heavily technology-driven - startup in Ho Chi Minh City.

As part of our ongoing efforts to support businesses that align with our vision, we have backed **MyStorage**, a growing player in Vietnam’s self-storage market.

## **How MyStorage was validated**

In the fall of 2024, the team leadership of BitcoinVN decided to move ahead and partake in the latest investment round by the fast-growing Self-Storage Provider MyStorage under the leadership of American-German Entrepreneur Aric Austin.

As with our [previous investment in South East Asia’s leading Lightning Service Provider Neutronpay](https://bitcoinvn.io/news/why-we-invested-into-neutronpay/), our team has been following the journey of the founder for several years beforehand and became an active (and satisfied!) customer and user of the product.

As BitcoinVN operates with a light physical infrastructure, MyStorage has proven to be an ideal fit for scaling our temporary and extended storage needs. Their seamless, transparent, and efficient service has made working with them a strategic match.

The ability to book transport directly through MyStorage further simplifies logistics, allowing us to save on our most scarce resources:

Time and mental capacity - so we can stay focused on solving the big problems for our own customers.

While the investment made is, in the grand scheme of things, not a significant amount _(as our team prepares for [further investments into our digital and physical infrastructure](https://x.com/Bitcoin_Vietnam/status/1874006696915591643) to provide a faster, smoother, more redundant, reliable, and resilient service offering)_, it stands as a demonstration of our trust and confidence in Aric and his team to execute on their vision.

Simply put - we’re **putting our money where our mouth is**.

While business investments inherently come with risks, and ["just hodling Bitcoin" (the right way)](http://bitcoinvn.io/custody) may offer a safer risk/reward, we believe in the proven execution capabilities, a clear market need (which we’ve experienced firsthand), and the ongoing economic growth of Vietnam - particularly in its key hub, Ho Chi Minh City, as reflected in our own HQ location.

That Aric launched a highly kinetic business and successfully navigated it through the lockdown years of 2020 and 2021 proves his ability to withstand even extreme adverse circumstances.

Keeping any business afloat during that time was no small feat - let alone one heavily dependent on moving goods in the physical world.

Not only that, MyStorage did not just cling on but actually expanded from their original facility in Thao Dien to a much larger flagship facility in Thu Duc once the initial concept was proven and the demand to scale operations arose.

## **The opportunity spotted and seized by MyStorage**

Most traditional warehouses in Vietnam are run in an “old-school” way, designed for large-scale bulk import and export operations.

This creates a gap in the market, especially in a rapidly urbanizing society with higher-density living and the global shift toward online commerce, where goods are marketed and sold directly via social media channels.

Renting commercial space in Saigon is expensive, which makes it a major challenge for new entrepreneurs who are just starting out and need storage. MyStorage offers flexible solutions that help bridge this gap, allowing entrepreneurs to operate when their apartment cupboard is no longer enough, but they’re not yet at a scale that justifies the cost of renting physical store space in Ho Chi Minh City.

As such, MyStorage provides essential infrastructure for new entrepreneurs to scale their businesses with low overhead costs, while offering the flexibility to scale. In doing so, it directly contributes to the entrepreneurial growth and dynamism in Vietnam.

That MyStorage operates _"on a different level"_ becomes evident upon visiting their spotless and well-organized facility in Thu Duc.

Everything is in its place - no clutter or flotsam - just a streamlined, clean, and well-run operation with meticulous attention to detail.

Aric and his team also tapped into new opportunities by expanding into Real Estate Partnerships, providing secure and flexible storage solutions within unused and underutilized spaces in larger commercial and residential buildings. This expansion increased the footprint of their Self-Storage solutions across a wider area of Vietnam’s largest city.

In 2025, Aric and his team launched Vietnam’s first dedicated wine storage facility which once again bets early on a rapidly rising trend from a very low base level, replicating the model that worked in other Asian mega cities who have been on a similar journey of rapidly providing wealth, prosperity, and the finer things in life to a rapidly expanding affluent middle class.

## **Transformation of Ho Chi Minh City into International Financial Centre**

Most recently, alongside various ambitious plans to make Vietnam a fully developed nation by mid-century, the country has selected Ho Chi Minh City as the location for its first International Financial Centre.

While expectations are running high, Dominic Scriven, chairman of Dragon Capital, Vietnam’s leading fund manager, has [pointed out that investments in infrastructure and logistics must remain a top priority](https://tuoitre.vn/chu-tich-dragon-capital-manh-dat-co-nhieu-giao-dich-lam-an-trung-tam-tai-chinh-se-hinh-thanh-20250113160557136.htm) to attract more commercial activity to the city.

We view our investment in MyStorage through this lens—contributing to the development of infrastructure and logistics required for a modern megacity in Asia, making commerce smoother and reducing friction for new entrepreneurs launching and scaling their operations, as well as global talent relocating to Ho Chi Minh City.

We are looking forward to collaborating further with Aric in the years to come and wish him and his team further persistence to expand and innovate in the upcoming/burgeoning self-storage sector in Vietnam!
