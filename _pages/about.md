BitcoinVN (formerly known as “Bitcoin Vietnam”) is [Vietnam’s premier Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency exchange](https://bitcoinvn.io), launched in early 2014.

Our founding team members have been involved in Bitcoin community building and software development since 2013.

## Our mission

Given our background and our pathway into the world of Bitcoin, we know that “making the world a better place” requires team- and community effort.

Many of the most brilliant builders in the Bitcoin space are severely strapped for resources.

If pure short-term profit maximization would be their goal, the “Blockchain-DLT-Web3-token-altcoin” sphere with its value-extractive dynamics would likely provide much higher monetary returns in the near future.

People who commit to Bitcoin do so for the long-term vision and bring a lot of sacrifices along the way to the benefit of the whole community.

And for a better future for humanity as a whole - building out the sound money standard upon which every sound society rests.

**Every profitable Bitcoin business hence should strive to allocate a certain part of their resources to support Open Source development.**

While as a Vietnam-based firm we are limited in the financial resources we can provide, our team has been mostly active especially in providing free localization to selected projects *(as well as spreading the word locally)*.

Some of our developers also regularly contribute to other Open Source projects and/or build OS projects on their own.

We hope to continue to be able to play our part in supporting the Open Source community within our means and abilities.
